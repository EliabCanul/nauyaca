# INSTALLATION

# nauyaca will be installed in a virtual environment in order to avoid
# the installation of packages and dependences in your default python environment.
# Python =>3.7 is required to avoid controverse versions. 
# The installation procedure consists in three main steps:
# 1.- Installing the dependency manager 'poetry'
# 2.- Cloning nauyaca and installing dependencies
# 3.- Set helpful variables in your bash 


# 1 =============================================

# The installation is managed by 'poetry'. If you have not installed, follow 
# the instructions in:   https://python-poetry.org/docs/
# For example, for osx/ linux/ bashonwindows, type in your /home directory:

curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python -

# It will download poetry. Then, type
source $HOME/.poetry/env

# type 
poetry

# It should display the poetry commands and options. If so, you're done.

2 =============================================

#Go to your /home directory

cd /home

# Clone the nauyaca's repository

git clone https://github.com/EliabCanul/nauyaca.git

# Change to nauyaca directory 

cd nauyaca


# Install the dependencies in pyproject.toml file by typing

poetry install

# Create the virtual environment for nauyaca,

poetry shell

# It will activate the nauyaca's virtual environment and will show the
# path where the environment lives. Something like:

/home/{myuser}/.cache/pypoetry/virtualenvs/nauyaca-qxobQ2ei-py3.7/bin/activate

# Copy YOUR path since it will be useful in the next step

# 3 =============================================

# In order to ease the nauyaca usage, define the following lines 
# in your .bash/.bashrc file. It's done only the first time you install nauyaca.

# nauyaca
# 3.1 Add the nauyaca directory to your python path, 

export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/home/{myuser}/nauyaca

# 3.2 Create an alias to activate nauyaca, using the path you copied above

alias nau='source /home/{myuser}/.cache/pypoetry/virtualenvs/nauyaca-qxobQ2ei-py3.7/bin/activate'

# 3.3 Make available poetry

source $HOME/.poetry/env

# save and exit your bash and source it
source .bashrc

# ===============
# If you get at this point, you should have installed nauyaca correctly ;-)

# In order to test the proper installation, open a new terminal and go to
# the Examples directory in nauyaca.


# Activate the nauyaca virtual environment each time you need it just by typing

nau

# It should activate nauyaca wherever in your computer you are

# Run the notebooks Documentation or in Examples, and see nauyaca in action!


===============
# A detailed explanation of these examples can be found in Examples/README file
