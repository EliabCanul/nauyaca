Python 3.7 is required. Also, -pipenv- is requiered to manage the dependencies.
If you do not have pipenv, install via: pip install pipenv or pip3 install pipenv

# Installation

**Go to your /home directory**

cd /home

**Clone the repository**

git clone https://github.com/EliabCanul/nauyaca.git

**Change to nauyaca directory**

cd nauyaca

**Install the dependencies**

pipenv install

**Close the terminal**

exit

**In the directory of your current shell (for example .bashrc), add the path to nauyaca**

export PYTHONPATH:/home/{mypc}/nauyaca

**substitute {mypc} for your pc name**

**source your shell file**

source .bashrc

**Testing the examples**

**In the nauyaca's main directory (where the Pipfile file is), initialize the virtual environment by typing**

pipenv shell

# Usage

**In Documentation, open the .html files to see the tutorials. These tutorials have the main aim of showing the main usage of Nauyaca, although currently it's not possible to run from the Jupyter notebooks, but from Python scripts.**

**More examples will be available soon.**
