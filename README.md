# nauyaca
Nauyaca is a tool for the TTVs inversion problem. Planetary masses and orbits are inferred from mid-transit times fitting.

See the Installation file for detailed steps to build nauyaca in your computer.

From your cloned folder, open the Documentation to explore jupyter notebooks (or .html files) to see interactive examples using nauyaca.

The Examples folder contains many scripts with extra features in nauyaca. More examples will be available soon!
